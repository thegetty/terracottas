    Light orange in color, and in certain places a slightly more intense shade
    (Munsell 7.5 yr 8/3); covered by a white slip (_latte di calce_). Traces of
    red are preserved on the claws.
  :condition: >
    This statue was reconstructed from several fragments; gaps can be seen in
    the short chiton and in the right claw. In the sections where the layer of
    white pigment has been preserved, the surface appears very smooth,
    especially in the hands and face.

  :description: |2
    The siren stands in a meditative pose. She is resting her long, slender
    legs, which terminate in four long talons, atop a rounded, rocky base
    marked by a series of protuberances. The upper part of her body is human
    in appearance: the right arm is folded beneath the breasts and the left
    hand is propped under the chin. The head is slightly tilted to the left,
    in keeping with an iconographic scheme generally employed to express
    grief or sadness. The features of the face resemble those of Orpheus.
    The face is full and round, with a prominent chin. The neck is short,
    marked by the “rings of Venus.” The eyes are asymmetrical, with the
    upper eyelid more pronounced and the arched eyebrows situated close to
    the eyelids. The nose is straight, with a rounded tip. The lips are
    fleshy and well designed. The face is framed by a hairstyle
    characterized by a series of roughly modeled, short, twisting curls
    applied to the top of the head and partially covering the ears. The
    figure is dressed in a short chiton with an *apoptygma* (cape-like fold)
    that clings to her body, forming pleats that are flattened on the front,
    while on the sides they open out as if tossed in the wind,
    with beautifully hand-modeled ruffles. A sash is wrapped high around the
    chest, with two shoulder straps crossing over the bust. In the back, the
    drapery extends to form a broad, tubular tail, flared toward the end
    like a fan. This tail also helped to balance the statue. In the back of
    the figure, the crossing shoulder straps cannot be seen.
