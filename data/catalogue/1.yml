    A life-size figure of a seated poet playing the kithara, identified as
    Orpheus, is flanked by two half-bird, half-woman sirens, who sing to mourn
    the dead and escort them to the Underworld. The unique group likely belonged
    to a funeral monument erected for a musician from the region of Taranto.

    Light orange in color, slightly purified with more intense shade (Munsell
    7.5 yr 8/3–8/5); the surface is covered by a white slip of calcium carbonate.
    Preserved pigments.

    **Footstool (76.AD.11.4):** Upper surface, sparse orange-gold pigment. The
    sides of the footstool show a greater preservation of the orange-gold pigment
    layer as well as some black pigment. The base (76.AD.11.5) has a reddish tone.

    **Chair:** Little pigment preservation on the sides; the legs were brightly
    colored in a gold-yellow pigment; the center panel of the chair back is also
    a gold color, similar to the legs, while the areas between the upper posts
    of the chair and the panel were red, indicating Orpheus’s garment.

    **Orpheus:** The head reveals traces of two colors in two layers: a red
    color layer partially covered with a layer of brown pigment. The drapery
    area is covered with a red pigment. The skin is pink.

    The musical instrument and the middle finger of the left hand are missing. 
    The figure was reassembled from a number of fragments prior to its
    acquisition by the J. Paul Getty Museum. The legs, the head, and several
    sections of the himation were reattached. Missing sections were filled in,
    especially on the chair in the area of the backrest and the rear portion of
    the torso. During this interval, for which no specific documentation exists,
    it is likely that invasive cleaning also damaged some of the ancient
    polychromy. Recent investigations have helped clarify that the obscuring
    encrustations were probably added at this time, especially on the body and
    the head, in order to conceal break lines and areas of fill, and to give the
    figure a more uniform appearance overall. The interior of the statue was
    also widely consolidated and reinforced with an added material, except in
    several sections where the clay is still visible. As a result, there are
    only a few places where the original marks of the modeling and the
    fingerprints of the coroplast can be observed. In 1983, exploratory cleaning
    on a limited portion of the footstool and chair was performed by the Getty’s
    Antiquities Conservation Department, revealing some of the original
    polychromy and the presence of footprints on the upper surface of the
    footstool.

  :description: |
    The male figure is shown sitting on a *klismos* (seat). The seat, with a
    broad, rounded backrest, is set on a low rectangular platform composed of
    two distinct sections. The first section has a concave outer edge and is an
    integral part of the chair, serving as its base; the second section is
    composed of a movable element with a convex edge that fits flush and snug
    against the first section. The rectangular openings on either side of the
    chair may have been used either to lift the figure or to provide ventilation
    during firing.

    The body is wrapped in a mantle that covers his left shoulder and part of
    his left arm, leaving his chest bare and showing wrinkles around the navel
    and the armpit. The mantle drops on either side with deep folds, covering
    the figure’s legs to the calves. The legs are slightly spread, so that the
    clay of the garment forms thin, deep folds. The right foot rests on the
    footstool, while only the tip of the left foot touches it. The figure is
    wearing flat sandals with thongs that cross on the top of the feet. The
    footstool is made of a rectangular slab with moldings and two lateral
    elements with a rounded shape, terminating in four corbels.

    The figure’s head is erect and turned toward the right. The face is rounded;
    the mouth, with its fleshy, carefully modeled lips, is partially open,
    revealing the upper dental arch; a dimple marks the point where the lower
    lip meets the prominent chin. The curling of the lower lip and the half-open
    mouth are both signs that this character was probably portrayed in the act
    of singing. The nose is straight, the nostrils are rounded, and the
    almond-shaped eyes have distinctly portrayed eyelids, with clearly depicted
    tear glands. The supraorbital arch, broad and close to the eye, runs
    directly into the upper part of the nose. The hair must have been painted,
    as was determined by a careful analysis of the nape of the neck, but it is
    possible that the head was partially covered by a headdress, as the modeling
    of the upper part of the forehead seems to suggest. The ears are well modeled.

    The right arm, its elbow resting against the torso, is bent, reaching forward
    to hold a plectrum, while the left hand was probably plucking the strings of
    a kithara. A trace of the instrument survives in the concavity where it must
    have rested on the left leg.
