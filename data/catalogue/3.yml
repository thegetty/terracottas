  :description: |2
    This siren is identical in the lower portion of her body to Siren A, but
    her stance and the position of her arms differ. Her left hand rests on
    her chest, and her right arm stretches out in front of her as if she were
    accompanying a song with movement.

    Her shoulder straps overlap in the opposite direction relative to those
    of the other siren. Her head, too, is turned upward and rotated to the
    right. On the rocky base and beneath her tail, there are three holes.
    Her left hand has a distinct mark of joining to the wrist, a detail
    found neither in her other hand nor in the other figure. On her left arm
    are signs of apparent folds, though that does not seem consistent with
    the type of short chiton she wears. About halfway up the back section of
    her body is an incised line; another can be detected at the end of the
    tail.
